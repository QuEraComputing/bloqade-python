# Reporting a Documentation Issue

We are always looking to improve our documentation. If you find
a typo or think something is unclear, please open an issue on
our GitHub page: https://github.com/QuEraComputing/bloqade-python/issues

For typos or other minor problems, create an issue that contains
a link to the specific page that includes the problem, along with
a description of the problem and possibly a solution.

For a request for new documentation content, please open up an
issue and describe what you think is missing from the documentation.
