For example, you can start to add atom sites to your program by selecting <code>add_position</code> method.</p> <pre><code>from bloqade import start\ncalculation = (\nstart\n.add_position((0, 0))\n.add_position((0, 6.8))\n.add_position([(6.8, 0), (6.8, 6.8)])\n)\n</code></pre> <p>If you want to start to build the Rydberg drive you can select the <code>rydberg</code> property.</p> <p><pre><code>from bloqade import start\ncalculation = (\nstart\n.add_position((0, 0))\n.add_position((0, 6.8))\n.add_position([(6.8, 0), (6.8, 6.8)])\n.rydberg\n)\n</code></pre> Note that from here on out, you can no longer add to your geometry as the <code>rydberg</code> property is terminal.</p> <p>From here, you can select the different parts of the Rydberg drive. For example, if you want to build the detuning part of the drive, you can choose the <code>detuning</code> property.</p> <pre><code>from bloqade import start\ncalculation = (\nstart\n.add_position((0, 0))\n.add_position((0, 6.8))\n.add_position([(6.8, 0), (6.8, 6.8)])\n.rydberg.detuning\n)\n</code></pre> <p>In the code above, <code>rydberg.detuning</code> indicates that the following set of methods and properties will be related to the Detuning of the Rydberg drive. You can also select <code>rabi.amplitude</code> or <code>rabi.phase</code> To build the amplitude and phase parts of the drive. Next, we will select the spatial modulation of the driving field.</p> <pre><code>from bloqade import start\ncalculation = (\nstart\n.add_position((0, 0))\n.add_position((0, 6.8))\n.add_position([(6.8, 0), (6.8, 6.8)])\n.rydberg.detuning.uniform\n)\n</code></pre> <p>Here, we selected the <code>uniform</code> property, indicating that the detuning will be uniform across the atoms. You can also select <code>var(name)</code> where <code>name</code> is the name of the variable defined using a string. Having variables will allow you to define a spatially varying detuning as a list of real numbers. You can also select individual atoms using the <code>location(index)</code> method, where <code>index</code> is the integer associated with the lattice. Now that we have the drive's spatial modulation, we can start to build the time dependence of the detuning field. Continuing with the example, we can add individual segments to the time function using <code>linear</code> or <code>constant</code> methods, or we have shortcuts to common waveforms like <code>piecewise_linear</code> or <code>piecewise_constant</code>. We use a piecewise linear function to define the Detuning waveform on Aquila.</p> <pre><code>from bloqade import start\ncalculation = (\nstart\n.add_position((0, 0))\n.add_position((0, 6.8))\n.add_position([(6.8, 0), (6.8, 6.8)])\n.rydberg.detuning.uniform.\npiecewise_linear(\ndurations = [0.1, 1.0 0.1],\nvalues = [-10, -10, 10, 10]\n)\n)\n</code></pre> <p>One can continue using the <code>.</code> to append more time-dependent segments to the uniform detuning waveform or select a different spatial modulation of the detuning field. The results will be that the new spatial modulation will be added to the existing spatial modulation. You can also start to build another field within the Rydberg drive by selecting the <code>amplitude</code> or <code>phase</code> properties.</p> <pre><code>from bloqade import start\ncalculation = (\nstart\n.add_position((0, 0))\n.add_position((0, 6.8))\n.add_position([(6.8, 0), (6.8, 6.8)])\n.rydberg.detuning.uniform.\npiecewise_linear(\ndurations = [0.1, 1.0 0.1],\nvalues = [-10, -10, 10, 10]\n)\n.amplitude.uniform.\npiecewise_linear(\ndurations = [0.1, 1.0 0.1],\nvalues = [0, 10, 10, 0]\n)\n)\n</code></pre> <p>If the next property is: 1. <code>hyperfine</code> will start to build the Hyperfine driving transition 2. <code>amplitude</code> or <code>rabi.amplitude</code> will start to build the rabi amplitude in the current context, e.g. rydberg 3. <code>phase</code> or <code>rabi.phase</code> will start to build the rabi phase in the current context 4. A spatial modulation will add a new channel to the current field, e.g. detuning 5. Repeating the previously specified spatial modulations will add that waveform with the previously defined waveform in that spatial modulation.</p> <pre><code>from bloqade import start\ncalculation = (\nstart\n.add_position((0, 0))\n.add_position((0, 6.8))\n.add_position([(6.8, 0), (6.8, 6.8)])\n.rydberg.detuning.uniform.\npiecewise_linear(\ndurations = [0.1, 1.0 0.1],\nvalues = [-10, -10, \"final_detuning\", \"final_detuning\"]\n)\n.amplitude.uniform.\npiecewise_linear(\ndurations = [0.1, 1.0 0.1],\nvalues = [0, 10, 10, 0]\n)\n)\n</code></pre> <p>A string can parameterize continuous values inside the program we call these run-time parameters. There are three ways to specify the value for these parameters; the first is to set the value via <code>assign</code>, which means that the variable will have the same assignment regardless of the run. The second is to specify the value via <code>batch_assign</code>, which assigns that parameter to a batch. When specifying a batch, the program will automatically execute a quantum teach for each parameter in the batch. The other method to define the variable is through <code>flatten</code>. This instruction will delay the specification of the variable till running/submitting the tasks, which is helpful for certain kinds of hybrid quantum-classical applications. Combined with the callable nature of the backends, it will make it very easy to create a quantum-classical loop. You can mix and match some of these methods, and the available options should pop up if you're using an IDE.</p> <p>Another helpful feature for small clusters of atoms is the <code>parallelize</code> option. The idea here is that the atoms are arranged in 2D space in some bounded square region for Aquila and other Neutral Atom machines. You can run multiple copies of that calculation in parallel for small clusters of atoms by spacing those clusters apart by some sufficiently large distance. Our infrastructure will automatically detect the area of the QPU and use that to generate the appropriate number of copies of the calculation. Also, when processing the results, it is possible to automatically stitch the results from the different copies together so that the analysis is unified on the original cluster.</p> <p>Now that we have specified all the options, we can think about how to run our program. We only support <code>braket</code>, which tells bloqade to submit your tasks to the braket service. The credentials are handled entirely by the braket SDK, so we suggest you look at their documentation for how to set that up. However, setting up your AWS credentials in your environment variables is the easiest way. To execute the program on Aquila, you select the <code>aquila</code> backend after the <code>braket</code> property.</p> <p><pre><code>from bloqade import start\ncalculation = (\nstart\n.add_position((0, 0))\n.add_position((0, 6.8))\n.add_position([(6.8, 0), (6.8, 6.8)])\n.rydberg.detuning.uniform.\npiecewise_linear(\ndurations = [0.1, 1.0 0.1],\nvalues = [-10, -10, \"final_detuning\", \"final_detuning\"]\n)\n.amplitude.uniform.\npiecewise_linear(\ndurations = [0.1, 1.0 0.1],\nvalues = [0, 10, 10, 0]\n)\n.batch_assign(detuning_final=[0,1,2,3,4])\n.braket.aquila()\n)\n</code></pre> For tasks executed through a remote API, there are three options to run your job. The first is an asynchronous call via <code>submit</code>, which will return a <code>RemoteBatch</code> object. This object has various methods to <code>fetch</code> and or <code>pull</code> results from the remote API, along with some other tools that can query the status of the task(s) in this batch. <code>run</code> is another method that blocks the script waiting for all the tasks to finish, susequently returning the <code>RemoteBatch</code>. The final option is to use the <code>__call__</code> method of the <code>calculation</code> object for hybrid workflows. The call object is effectively the same as calling <code>run</code>. However, specifying the <code>flatten</code> option will allow you to call <code>__call__</code> with arguments corresponding to the list of strings provided by <code>flatten</code>.</p> <p>The <code>RemoteBatch</code> object can be saved in JSON format using the <code>save_batch</code> and reloaded back into Python using the <code>load_batch</code> functions. This capability is useful for the asynchronous case, where you can save the batch and load it back later to retrieve the results.</p> <p>The braket service also provides a local emulator, which can be run by selecting the <code>local_emulator()</code> options after the <code>braket</code> property. There is no asynchronous option for local emulator jobs, so you can only call <code>run</code> or <code>__call__</code> methods, and the return result is a <code>LocalBatch</code>.</p> <p>The batch objects also have a method <code>report</code> that returns a <code>Report</code> object. This object will contain all the data inside the batch object, so if no results are present in the <code>RemoteBatch</code>, then the <code>Report</code> will not have any data either. A common pattern would be first to call <code>fetch</code> and then create the <code>Report</code> by calling <code>report</code>.
