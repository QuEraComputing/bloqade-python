A Program starting point, alias of empty
[`ListOfLocations`][bloqade.core.ir.location.location.ListOfLocations].

- Next possible steps to build your program are:
- Specify which level coupling to address with:
    - `start.rydberg`: for [`Rydberg`][bloqade.core.builder.coupling.Rydberg]
        Level coupling
    - `start.hyperfine`: for [`Hyperfine`][bloqade.core.builder.coupling.Hyperfine]
        Level coupling
    - LOCKOUT: You cannot add atoms to your geometry after specifying level coupling.
- continue/start building your geometry with:
    - `start.add_position()`: to add atom(s) to current register. It will accept:
        - A single coordinate, represented as a tuple (e.g. `(5,6)`) with a value that
          can either be:
            - integers: `(5,6)`
            - floats: `(5.1, 2.5)`
            - strings (for later variable assignment): `("x", "y")`
            - [`Scalar`][bloqade.core.ir.scalar.Scalar] objects:
              `(2*cast("x"), 5+cast("y"))`
        - A list of coordinates, represented as a list of types mentioned previously.
        - A numpy array with shape (n, 2) where n is the total number of atoms
